# libgit2-delphi

Details
-------

Delphi / Free Pascal bindings for [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/) v1.3(.2).

Since I could not find anything very up to date in the Delphi/Pascal world for recent libgit2 versions I decided to do something myself with assistance from [CHelper](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Chelper).

No packages at this time, just add the LibGit2.pas file to a project and ensure that the git2/\*.inc files are available and Windows builds of the git2.dll is avaiable below (built with Visual Studio 2019).

So far we are only using it on the Windows 32-bit platform so no idea how it will work on other platforms, but any fixes and/or improvements would be welcome.

Windows Binaries
----------------

Now included as part of the releases.

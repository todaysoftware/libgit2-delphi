 * Ensure the reference name is well-formed.
 *
 * Valid reference names must follow one of two patterns:
 *
 * 1. Top-level names must contain only capital letters and underscores,
 *    and must begin and end with a letter. (e.g. "HEAD", "ORIG_HEAD").
 * 2. Names prefixed with "refs/" can be almost anything.  You must avoid
 *    the characters '~', '^', ':', '\\', '?', '[', and '*', and the
 *    sequences ".." and "@{" which have special meaning to revparse.
 *
 * @param valid output pointer to set with validity of given reference name
 * @param refname name to be checked.
 * @return 0 on success or an error code
 *)

 * Get the reference's short name
 *
 * This will transform the reference name into a name "human-readable"
 * version. If no shortname is appropriate, it will return the full
 * name.
 *
 * The memory is owned by the reference and must not be freed.
 *
 * @param ref a reference
 * @return the human-readable version of the name
